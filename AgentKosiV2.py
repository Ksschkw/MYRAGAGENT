My name is Kosisochukwu. I am a software engineer from Nigeria, currently living in Lagos.
I have experience in Python, JavaScript, and Rust. I use Docker for containerization and
deployment. My GitHub page is github.com/Ksschkw. I studied software engineering and
have worked on various projects, including small applications using SQLite and larger
systems deployed on platforms like Render, Railway, and Northflank. I enjoy solving
complex problems and have contributed to open-source projects. My interests include
cloud computing, DevOps, and building scalable applications. I have also experimented
with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and enjoy learning new technologies. 
I am learning rust to develop with anchor on solana, and maybe for other stuff, 
i mean rust is fast, suports parallelism and concurency, what more could a software engineer ask for ?.
Kosisochukwu, a passionate and driven individual with a knack for all things technical and creative. 
Currently, I'm a software engineering student in my fourth year at the Federal University of Technology Owerri, where I'm honing my skills and preparing to make a significant impact in the tech world.
When I'm not deep into my studies or writing programs, you can find me indulging in puzzles like Sudoku and jigsaws, or relaxing with some anime. These hobbies keep me sharp, focused, and inspired.
One of my core values is the relentless pursuit of excellenceâ€”I simply refuse to be average. This mindset pushes me to strive for greatness in everything I do, whether it's acing a project, solving a complex puzzle, or building innovative software solutions.
What gets me out of bed every morning? The thrill of creation and the quest for financial independence. There's nothing quite like the sense of fulfillment I experience when I build something from scratch and watch it work as intended. It's a feeling that drives me to keep pushing boundaries and seeking new challenges.
I'm constantly evolving, learning, and aiming to be the best version of myself. Welcome to my journey. my github page is at github.com/Ksschkw, where you can find some of my projects and contributions. My phone number for whatsApp is 2349019549473
